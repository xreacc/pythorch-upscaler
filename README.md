# pythorch-upscaler
not the best but good enough as a small project


the dataset used is DIV2K_train_LR_bicubic (800 images in X2 folder as target data and i downstacled them as imput data)
it upsclaes in 128x128 chunks (that can be changed) so there are visible lines in the upscaled images
and also is the image had artifacts they will also be visible

maybe it will be better if i train it with more data (duh)
also adding anime data wouldn't be bad

otehr than that it looks a more blurry than i would've wanted but i think if i add more unet layers and/or train it for longer that will improve
